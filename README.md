Crawl - PHP Email Crawler
========================

This is a basic example of an easy-2-use email adress web crawler in PHP. Install cURL on the host system if you want to get a perfomance boost. You have to run this script in the php command line. This is the initial release and there are tons of bugs and ugly code due to my laziness.

Features:
---------

+ Easy to use, just run the script
+ Catch emails from endless websites
+ I'll add more features in later versions

Example usage:
-------------

test@trial~# php crawl.php http://www.nein-zur-transferunion-fuer-stabiles-geld.de/e-mails-der-bundestagsabgeordneten/ 1
