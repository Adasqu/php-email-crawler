php-email-crawler
=================

This is a basic example of an easy-2-use email adress web crawler in PHP. Install cURL on the host system if you want to get a perfomance boost. You have to run this script in the php command line.

It is the initial release and there are tons of bugs and ugly code due to my laziness. Be aware that this little program might not work on your system yet.
Example usage: ~# php crawl.php http://www.nein-zur-transferunion-fuer-stabiles-geld.de/e-mails-der-bundestagsabgeordneten/ 1
